Creating the Career Search Hub:

This idea was actually one that belonged to a friend's younger sister. She had been playing around in Adobe premier and had made a design for a website with no functionality so I thought, why not give her some functionality! Although what I made isn't a final product and will definitely need to be updated and edited in the future, it's a good representation of the MVC concepts we were taught in this phase. I plan on continuially working on it, to help Kelly create the perfect website for her vision.
